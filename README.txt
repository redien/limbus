Limbus
https://sourceforge.net/projects/limbus/

A cross-platform multimedia library aimed at supporting a wide range of programming languages.
It exposes a set of C APIs used to generate high-level object-oriented bindings for supported languages at compile-time.

Currently binding generators exists for C++, C#, Lua, Python and Ruby

Current release is an alpha release which means that it has not gone through a lot of testing yet.
The core APIs such as window/opengl_context/mouse/keyboard should be fairly stable but will most likely
get minor changes until the library is stable enough for an actual stable release.

The Lua and C++ bindings are the ones that have been developed and tested the most but the other bindings should be functional.
