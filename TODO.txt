
List of things to do:
-----------------------

- Bug: X11 LBWindow implementation seems to halt the application when setting a caption.
       Looks like it only occurs when there are a specific number of events queued.
- Replace asserts with real error handling.
	- Have lb_*_constructed return an error message when
	  constructing an object fails.
- Look over the LBTablet API and make sure it compiles on all platforms.
	- Fix X11 implementation.
- Implement custom_context.h for X11.
- Turn off use of bundled Lua in the repo and make the use of Lua configurable.
- Add CMake variables for disabling all of the subsystems.
- Add events for windows getting focused/unfocused
- Clean up WinAPI implementations.
	- Clear up window positioning
- Write a Main page for the Doxygen documentation.
- Write tutorials for setting up a window and OpenGL context.
- Update all of the examples.
- Clarify project description in the README and on SF.net.
- Standardize filenames for implementation source files.
- Make sure the library compiles as C++.
- Research ways of testing the library and implement new tests.
- Make it possible for the users to plug-in their own code for memory handling.
- Add support for OpenGL 3.0+ contexts.
- Add clipboard API
- Write an implementation for MacOS.
